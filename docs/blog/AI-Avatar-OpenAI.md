# Update my avatar with AI (OpenAI)

After several attempts to redesign my avatar which was created in 1999 with Flash. I feed different AI models with Hugging Chat.

## __Q:__ Itâ€™s my avatar. I think a old version. Could update this version with a modern design. Thanks

My view of what OpenAI has just generated is that it doesn't have much imagination.
